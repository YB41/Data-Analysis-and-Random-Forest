# Data-Analysis-and-Random-Forest
This git holds an example of a data analysis on a Diabetes Dataset found under: https://www.kaggle.com/code/devraai/diabetes-data-analysis-modeling and can be downloaded there.
The goal was to provide an overview of how to choose variables and restrict the model only onto the most important ones. See Analysis.ipynb for more information and how the
modelling was done. Additionally, a Random Forest Algorithm was applied to the reduced Dataset under diabetes_selected_features.csv - and used in the Prediction Modelling.ipynb
Notebook.
